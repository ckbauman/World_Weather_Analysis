# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6

## Overview
We are reviewing Weather analysis for various locations around the world to deterimine an ideal vacation itinerary based on weather parameters.


## Results

We have created a Weather Database for 2,000 locations.  These locations were created using a random generator for Latitude and Longitude.  This file is called:

- Weather_Database.ipynb

Our second analysis finds hotels for select locations based on weather parameters chosen by a client.  We created a list of locations and a google image showing these locations. This file is called:

- Vacation_search.ipynb

Out third analysis uses the locations created in the prior analysis.  We then determined a travel itinerary based on 4 locations.  This created a google driving map and a location map.  This file is called:

- Vacation_itinerary.ipynb



## Summary

It is interesting using API connections for weather and Google maps.
